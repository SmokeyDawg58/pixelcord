# Pixelcord

*A Discord theme that's based on Material Design!*
*And features way too many animations!!!*

`// TODO: Preview image`

> This theme is not yet finished, it is currently being polished! Any feedback is appreciated

## Enhancements

This theme is best paired with the complementary plugin [Discord Theme Helper](https://github.com/hyblocker/discord-theme-helper). It allows the ripple effect to move with your mouse!

This plugin is customisable. A lot can be changed via CSS variables (See index.css), but a sizable portion can be customisable at compile time (I use NodeSASS to compile this theme). A refactoring of the theme is planned sometime in the near future to get around this issue!
